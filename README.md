## What I'm Learning!
> What I've learned so far:  HTML - the "Bones", CSS - the "Skin", and JavaScript - the "Movements", and all the fluff that goes along with JavaScript, such as JQuery, Node.js, Bootstrap, Materialize, several npm packages (there's really so many to explore), testing practices, Insomnia, Postman, and my personal favorite navigating and commiting to GitHub. :heart:
